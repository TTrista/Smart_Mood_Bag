## üì¶ Project Overview

    This project consists of **two main parts**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Physical Device

- Built-in hospital-grade ECG sensor module (AD8232)
- Measures HR and HRV, analyzes emotional states in real-time
- Wireless data transmission via Bluetooth
- Designed as a fashionable crossbody bag for daily wear ‚Äî discreet and comfortable

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile Application

- Developed with **Flutter**, supports both Android and iOS
- Connects with the physical device via Bluetooth
- Receives, displays and records ECG, HR and HRV data
- Provides real-time data visualization: ECG charts and emotional state trends
- Sends push notifications when abnormal stress or emotion patterns are detected

---
## üåü Key Features
- Medical-grade accuracy: Uses AD8232 ECG chip for reliable heart data.

- Always-on monitoring: Stay aware of stress or emotional changes.

- Discreet & stylish: Blends into daily outfits as a fashionable accessory.

- Wireless & real-time: Smooth Bluetooth connection with mobile app.

- Open-source: Both hardware and software source code are available for further research and development.
